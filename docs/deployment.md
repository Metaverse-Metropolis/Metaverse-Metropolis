# Deployment Guide

This document explains how to deploy the Metaverse Metropolis AI Agent to a production environment.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before deploying the AI Agent, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Docker (optional, but recommended for containerized deployment)
- Git
- A cloud provider account (AWS, Azure, etc.) or local server

## 2. Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your server or local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-repository/metaverse-metropolis-ai-agent.git  
cd metaverse-metropolis-ai-agent

### Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:

python3 -m venv env  
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Set up any necessary environment variables for configuration, such as API keys or database connections. You can create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following format:

API_KEY=your-api-key  
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url

### Step 5: Run the Application

Run the AI Agent:

python src/main.py

### Step 6: Set Up Docker (Optional)

If you want to deploy the application in a Docker container, use the following steps:

1. Create a `Dockerfile` in the root directory:

FROM python:3.8-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY . /app

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

CMD ["python", "src/main.py"]

2. Build and run the Docker container:

docker build -t metaverse-metropolis-ai-agent .  
docker run -p 5000:5000 metaverse-metropolis-ai-agent

## 3. Scaling and Maintenance

For scaling the application, consider using a cloud provider to deploy multiple instances and a load balancer for distributing traffic. Additionally, ensure that monitoring and logging are set up to track the performance of the AI Agent in production.
