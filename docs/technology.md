# Technology Stack

This document provides an overview of the technology stack used in the Metaverse Metropolis AI Agent project.

## 1. Programming Language

The project is primarily built using **Python 3.8+**, which is a widely used programming language for AI and machine learning tasks. Python's simplicity and rich ecosystem make it ideal for the development of complex applications like the AI Agent.

## 2. Web Framework

We use **Flask**, a lightweight web framework for Python, to expose RESTful APIs. Flask allows us to build flexible and scalable web applications and services, and it is well-suited for creating APIs that interact with our AI Agent.

## 3. Database

The AI Agent stores relevant data (such as logs, user inputs, and configuration) in a **relational database** like **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**. These databases are used to store persistent data, which the agent accesses to make informed decisions.

## 4. Docker

For containerization, we use **Docker** to package the application and its dependencies into a single container. Docker enables us to deploy the application consistently across different environments, whether locally, in staging, or in production.

## 5. Machine Learning and AI

The AI Agent utilizes machine learning algorithms to process data and make decisions. The algorithms are implemented using libraries such as **TensorFlow** or **scikit-learn**.

## 6. Deployment

For deployment, we utilize cloud platforms like **AWS** or **Azure**, which provide scalable infrastructure to host the application. The application can also be containerized and deployed via **Kubernetes** to manage scaling and availability.

## 7. Version Control

The project uses **Git** for version control and **GitHub** for code hosting, collaboration, and issue tracking. All changes to the codebase are tracked, and contributors can work together using Git and GitHub workflows.
