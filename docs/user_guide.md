# User Guide

This document provides instructions for users on how to interact with the Metaverse Metropolis AI Agent, including setup, usage, and troubleshooting.

## 1. Setting Up the AI Agent

To get started with the Metaverse Metropolis AI Agent, follow the setup instructions in the `docs/setup_guide.md`. These instructions will guide you through the process of cloning the repository, setting up the environment, and running the application.

## 2. Interacting with the AI Agent

### API Endpoints

The AI Agent exposes several API endpoints that allow you to interact with it. You can use these endpoints to:

- Retrieve the agent's current status.
- Trigger actions for the agent to perform.
- Update agent configurations.

Refer to the `docs/api_reference.md` for detailed information on available API endpoints and how to use them.

### Example Use Case: Getting the Status

To get the current status of the agent, send a `GET` request to the `/agent-status` endpoint:

curl -X GET "https://api.metaverse-metropolis.com/agent-status" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

### Example Use Case: Executing an Action

To trigger an action, send a `POST` request to the `/execute-action` endpoint:

curl -X POST "https://api.metaverse-metropolis.com/execute-action" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"action": "start_task", "params": {"task_id": 12345}}'

## 3. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the AI Agent, here are some common solutions:

### Issue: API Key Error

- Ensure that you are passing a valid API key in the request headers.
- Double-check the key by referring to the `docs/setup_guide.md` for instructions on how to generate your API key.

### Issue: Agent Not Responding

- Ensure that the agent is properly running by checking the logs or status endpoint.
- If you're using Docker, check if the container is running correctly with `docker ps`.
