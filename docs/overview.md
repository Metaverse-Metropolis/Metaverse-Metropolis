# Project Overview

The Metaverse Metropolis AI Agent is an advanced AI-powered system designed to interact with a decentralized metaverse. This project aims to provide intelligent decision-making capabilities for virtual environments and blockchain integration.

## Features

- **AI Agent Activation:** The ability to activate or deactivate the agent based on specific commands.
- **API Interaction:** RESTful API to interact with the agent and retrieve its status, or execute actions.
- **Virtual Environment Compatibility:** Designed to work in virtual environments for easy deployment and testing.

## Key Technologies

- **Python 3.8+**: The application is built using Python, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and ease of use.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the RESTful API.
- **Machine Learning**: The agent is powered by machine learning algorithms to enhance its decision-making capabilities.

## Use Cases

- **Virtual Worlds:** The agent can be deployed to manage virtual assets or interact with users in virtual environments.
- **Blockchain Integration:** The agent can interact with decentralized applications (dApps) to perform actions based on blockchain data.
