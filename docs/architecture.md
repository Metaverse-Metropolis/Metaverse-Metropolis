# System Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the Metaverse Metropolis AI Agent. It describes the components and their interactions, providing a clear understanding of how the system operates.

## 1. Overview

The architecture of the Metaverse Metropolis AI Agent is designed to be modular and scalable. It consists of several key components that work together to provide seamless operation:

- **AI Engine:** The core of the system that makes intelligent decisions based on data input.
- **API Layer:** A RESTful API that allows interaction with the AI agent, enabling external systems to control and query the agent.
- **Database Layer:** Stores historical data, logs, and configurations required for the agent's operation.
- **User Interface (UI):** A front-end interface that provides a way for users to interact with the agent (optional, can be customized based on the deployment).

## 3. Key Components

- **AI Engine:** The agent's decision-making logic. It processes incoming data and makes decisions based on pre-defined rules or machine learning models.
- **API Layer:** Exposes endpoints that allow external applications to interact with the AI agent. It facilitates functions like retrieving the agent's status and triggering actions.
- **Database Layer:** Stores data related to the agent's interactions, including logs, performance metrics, and configuration settings.
- **User Interface:** A graphical or command-line interface that allows users to interact with the agent. This can be customized based on specific use cases.
